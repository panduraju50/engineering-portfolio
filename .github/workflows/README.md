# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files (`.yml` or `.yaml`) for automating CI/CD processes.

## Examples

- **Build and Test:** A workflow that triggers on push/pull_request to build the application and run unit/integration tests.
- **Linting:** A workflow to check code style and quality.
- **Docker Build and Push:** A workflow to build Docker images and push them to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GCR, ECR).
- **Deploy to Staging/Production:** Workflows to deploy the application to different environments upon specific triggers (e.g., merge to main, tag creation).

These workflows help in maintaining code quality, ensuring application stability, and automating the deployment pipeline.
