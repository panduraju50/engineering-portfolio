# Patterns to ignore when building packages.
# This supports shell glob matching, relative path matching, and absolute path matching.
# E.g.
#
# .DS_Store
# .git/
# .gitignore
# .gitmodules
# .helmignore
# charts/
# examples/
# README.md.gotmpl
# test/
# testdata/

# Ignore common files
.DS_Store
.project
.settings
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# Ignore Git files
.git/
.gitignore
.gitattributes

# Ignore CI/CD specific files if any
.circleci/
.travis.yml
Jenkinsfile

# Ignore test files within the chart itself if not part of templates
tests/
test/

# Ignore temporary files
tmp/
*.tmp
*.bak
*.old

# If you have a parent chart and this is a subchart, you might ignore its values if they are overridden by the parent
# values.yaml.example # If you have example value files you don't want to package
# README.md # If your README is for source control only and not for the packaged chart (though often it's included)
