# Jenkins Pipelines

This directory contains `Jenkinsfile` examples or shared library configurations for CI/CD pipelines managed by Jenkins.

## Purpose

Jenkins is a powerful automation server that can be used to build, test, and deploy applications. `Jenkinsfile`s define these pipelines as code.

## Examples

- **Declarative Pipelines:** Modern, structured way to define Jenkins pipelines.
- **Scripted Pipelines:** More flexible, Groovy-based pipeline definitions.
- **Integration with GitHub:** Triggering Jenkins jobs from GitHub webhooks.
- **Multi-branch Pipelines:** Automatically creating pipelines for different branches in a repository.
- **Deployment Stages:** Defining stages for deploying to various environments (dev, staging, prod).

This section will showcase how Jenkins can be leveraged for robust CI/CD automation, complementing or as an alternative to GitHub Actions.
