### 📝 Task Simplicity Checklist
#### 🧐 Clarify the Goal
- [ ] What’s the one core outcome I need to deliver?
- [ ] Who is this for and what problem am I solving?
#### 🎯 Identify Core Requirements
- [ ] List the must-have features, no more than 3.
 [ ] Note any “nice-to-haves” separately.
#### 💡 Brainstorm Minimal Solutions
- [ ] Jot down 2–3 possible approaches.
- [ ] For each: “What’s the simplest version of this?”
#### 🚀 Build the MVP
- [ ] Implement only the must-haves.
- [ ] Keep interfaces (UI/API) as lean as possible.
#### ✅ Validate & Test
- [ ] Does the MVP meet the core goal end-to-end?
- [ ] Gather quick feedback (yourself or a user).
#### 🛠️ Add Complexity Only As Needed
- [ ] Which edge-cases truly require extra code?
- [ ] Which “nice-to-haves” add real value?
#### ✂️ Prune & Refine
- [ ] Remove any feature or config that isn’t essential.
- [ ] Simplify names, configs, and documentation.
#### 🔁 Iterate
- [ ] Can I simplify further?
- [ ] Are there parts I don’t understand at first glance?
#### 📦 Final Check
- [ ] Is the code/flow easy for someone new to follow?
- [ ] Is there any “magic” left—if so, can I make it explicit?
