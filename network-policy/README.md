# Kubernetes Network Policies

This section of the portfolio demonstrates the implementation and importance of Kubernetes Network Policies.

## Overview

Kubernetes Network Policies are specifications of how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. They are a powerful tool for enforcing network segmentation and security within a Kubernetes cluster.

Network Policies are Namespace-scoped resources. They use labels to select pods and define rules which specify what traffic is allowed to and from those pods.

## Importance

- **Security:** By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other. Network Policies allow you to restrict this communication, reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement in case of a compromise.
- **Isolation:** They enable you to isolate different applications or tenants running in the same cluster, ensuring that they cannot interfere with each other.
- **Compliance:** For many regulatory frameworks, network segmentation is a requirement. Network Policies help in achieving and demonstrating compliance.

## Implementation in this Project

This project will showcase practical examples of Network Policies, including:

- Default deny policies.
- Allowing traffic from specific namespaces or pods.
- Allowing traffic to external services.
- Policies for ingress and egress traffic.

The policies will be defined as YAML files and can be applied to a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f <policy-file.yaml>`.

We will also explore managing Network Policies using Helm charts for easier deployment and versioning.

Stay tuned for concrete examples and configurations!
