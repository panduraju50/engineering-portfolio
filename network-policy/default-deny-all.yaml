spec:
  podSelector: {} # An empty podSelector selects all pods in the namespace
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  # This policy has no rules, so it denies all ingress and egress traffic
  # for all pods in the namespace it's applied to.
  # This is a common starting point for a secure setup.
  # You would then add other policies to allow specific traffic.
